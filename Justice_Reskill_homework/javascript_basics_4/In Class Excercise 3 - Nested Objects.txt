var student = {
  name : "Aaron",
  program : "Front End",
  module : 5,
  alum : false,
  allergies : ['nuts', 'fish'],
  projects : {
    dogParty : "n/a",
    intentionTimer : null,
    checkYoSelf : null
  }
}

Write the syntax that would access the notes from Maddy’s Dog Party: student.projects.dogParty;
Write the syntax that would access the notes from Maddy’s Intention Timer: student.projects.intentionTimer;
Write the syntax that will give Maddy a note of “Great Job!” for Check Yo Self: student.projects.checkYoSelf = "Great Job!";
Why do you think the value of the intentionTimer property is assigned to null in the original object? Probably because there is no notes saved about the project.

var student = {
  name : "Rebecca",
  program : "Front End",
  module : 1,
  alum : false,
  proejcts: ["Dog Party", "Number Guesser", "Check Yo Self"]
}
Write a function that console.logs a sentence following this format: [name] is an awesome [program] student! They have built the following projects: [project1], [project2], and [project3]. This function should be dynamic enough so that when Rebecca (in this case) adds another project to her list, the function would return an appropriate end of the sentence (i.e. [project1], [project2], [project3], and [project4]).

var student = {
  name : "Rebecca",
  program : "Front End",
  module : 1,
  alum : false,
  projects: ["Dog Party", "Number Guesser", "Check Yo Self", "Another One"]
}

function SentenceOutput() {
  var projects = '';
  for (var i = 0; i < student.projects.length; i++) {
    if (i > 0) projects += ", ";
    if (i == student.projects.length-1) projects += "and ";
    projects += student.projects[i];
  }
  projects += ".";

  console.log(student.name + " is an awesome " + student.program + " student.  They have built the following projects: " + projects);
}
SentenceOutput();
