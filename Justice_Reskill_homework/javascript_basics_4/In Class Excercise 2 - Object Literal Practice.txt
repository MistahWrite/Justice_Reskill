var artist = {
    name : "Mistah Write",
    topTenHits : 3,

var student = {
    name: "Francy",
    program: "Front End",
    module: 5,
    alum: true
}
Write the syntax that will access the value "Front End": student.program;
Write the syntax that will access the value true: student.alum;
What will happen if you call francy.module? Why? francy.module returns 5. if you call it then it probably comes up with an error.

var student = {
    name : "Tristan",
    program : "Front End",
    module : 1,
    alum: false
}

Write the syntax that will move Tristan to Module 2: student.module = 2;
Write the syntax that will move Tristan to Module 5: student.module = 5;
Write the syntax that will make Tristan an alum: student.alum = true;
What will happen if you run tristan.module = 3? Why? undefined because the object name is student not tristan so it will come up with an error since JavaScript wouldn't recognize it that way yet.
